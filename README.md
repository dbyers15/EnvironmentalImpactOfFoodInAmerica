# EnvironmentalImpactOfFoodInAmerica
For this group project, we were interested in finding out which geographical region in the United States of America had food dishes with the lowest relative environmental impact. By measuring the environmental impact for each region through assessing the greenhouse gas emissions and water footprints of each of the dish's ingredients (except for seafood water footprints; see limitations section below), we found that the western geographical region had the lowest relative environmental impact and the southwest had the highest environmental impact. However, this result must be taken with a grain of salt because further data analysis revealed that although there is a difference in environmental impact for each geographical region, these differences are *not* statistically significant.
